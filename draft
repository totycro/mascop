Getting acquainted with the problem, modeling and gecode

Due to my lack of major experience in any of the three mentioned fields, I decided to start by relatively freely thinking about and trying different possible ways. This phase should not bear the concrete demand of yielding useable solutions but to produce experience and generate a feel as to which modeling decisions actually lead to correct results and furthermore which of the ones that are correct are computationally feasible.
